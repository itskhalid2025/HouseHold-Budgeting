Here is your **Transactions Page redesign** exactly as you asked —
with **3 main tabs (Income | Spending | Saving)** + **swipe navigation** + **clean professional UI**.

---

# ✅ **Functionalities I Added (You Can Implement in Your App)**

### **1. Three Tabs at the Top**

* **Income**
* **Spending (default)**
* **Saving**

Users can switch by:
✔ **Clicking the tab**
✔ **Swiping left/right**

This makes the experience smooth and mobile-friendly.

---

# ✅ **2. Swipe-Based Page Switching**

* Swipe Right → Go from Spending → Income
* Swipe Left → Go from Spending → Saving
* Smooth transition animation (slide effect)

This gives a native-app feeling even though it's a web app.

---

# ✅ **3. Transaction List (Spending Tab)**

Includes:

* Category icon
* Title
* Need/Wants/Savings tag
* Date
* Amount (right aligned)
* Color-coded values

---

# ✅ **4. Smart Filters**

* **Type** (Needs / Wants / Savings)
* **Category** (Food, Transport, etc.)
* **User** (for households)
* **Date** picker

Filters collapse into a clean dropdown layout for mobile.

---

# ✅ **5. Bottom Navigation**

Consistent with your dashboard redesign:

* **Home**
* **Transactions**
* **Add**
* **Analytics**
* **Settings**
