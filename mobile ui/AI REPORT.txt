Here is your Redesigned Analytics Page — exactly with everything you requested:
✔ Weekly / Monthly / Custom reports
✔ Scrollable reports
✔ Pie chart
✔ Embedded AI Advisor section
✔ Clean + Professional UI (Style A)

✅ Functionalities You Can Add (Implementation Guide)

Below is everything included in the redesigned Analytics Page and how you can implement each in your app.

🔵 1. Top Tabs (Weekly, Monthly, Custom)
Behavior:

Default = Weekly

Clicking a tab switches the dataset + charts.

Smooth underline animation or fade switch.

Implementation:
const [mode, setMode] = useState("weekly");

// render UI
<Tabs
  value={mode}
  onChange={(newValue) => setMode(newValue)}
  options={["weekly", "monthly", "custom"]}
/>

🔵 2. Scrollable Financial Report Section
Features:

A card that expands vertically

Scrollable content inside

Clean hierarchy:

Total Spent

Income

Needs/Wants/Savings

Insights

Warning messages

Implementation:
.report-card {
  max-height: 320px;
  overflow-y: auto;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 12px;
  background: #fff;
}

🔵 3. Pie Chart (Needs / Wants / Savings)

Use charting libraries like:

Chart.js

Recharts

Nivo

Example (Recharts):
<PieChart>
  <Pie
    data={data}
    dataKey="value"
    outerRadius={80}
    fill="#8884d8"
    label
  />
</PieChart>

🔵 4. AI Advisor Panel (Chat + Insights)
Features:

Fixed card under the graph

Auto-generated insights (like you already have)

Suggested questions:

How can I save more money?
